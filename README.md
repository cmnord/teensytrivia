#Teensy Trivia

6.S08 final project
Claire Nord and Jenny Xu

##To do
- Get SD card working: display images
- Replace buttons with joystick
- Test responses.py as interface between teensy and response_db
- Figure out how rounds are going to look in the database: 
- 1. Delete all entries in the database after each round and check for when there are entries = # players
- 2. Push one entry for each player and update each person's row until you get everyone's roundID = currentRound'

##Milestones
- April 28: Multiplayer support: how to sync up, join a game together
- May 1: Dynamic leaderboard
- May 8: Menu on Teensy: join new game, view leaderboard
- May 15: Graphics and sound
